# CME WIDI Bud Pro

* Dual Role Bluetooth-LE MIDI (Host & Peripheral)
* Low Latency
* Driver-Less Operation\*

The CME WIDI Bud Pro is a fantastic way to interface [Mezzz](../mezzz-and-vidos/mezzz-manual.md) with [Hypno](broken-reference). The bi-directional Bluetooth USB MIDI interface is plug-and-play, making it easy to use with nothing to install. Use it to combine Mezzz with other USB devices that lack a Bluetooth connection, or wirelessly send MIDI information to Hypno using our [Hypno4Live Max Device.](https://sleepycircuits.com/hypno-for-live) The WIDI Bud Pro is a great addition to any of our Sleepy Circuits products.

**\*WINDOWS 11 users**: In order for the WIDI Bud Pro to be recognized by computers running Windows 11, a new driver is required. Please head over to CME's official website and download [here.](https://www.cme-pro.com/widi-bud-pro-start-guide-bluetooth-midi-dongle/#tve-jump-1893f69e487)
