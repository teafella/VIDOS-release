## How do I Use Hypno

<details>

<summary>How do I use Hypno?</summary>

The full graphic manual, along with many video demonstrations of individual functions, can be found on the [Hypno Manual](hypno-manual.md). We also have a [YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/@SleepyCircuits) that we regularly update, so be sure to subscribe. Many operational questions may be answered or linked inside this FAQ. You can also browse our[ forums](https://forum.sleepycircuits.com) for a variety of topics related to using Hypno.

## How can I "reset" Hypno to its default state?

<details>

<summary>How can I “reset” Hypno to its default state?</summary>

Hypno always boots to the default patch, but to save yourself the time and effort of power cycling, you can use one of Hypno’s built-in features: presets. Simply save a preset of the default patch, and you’ll be able to recall it whenever you want! Check out [our video on presets](https://youtu.be/JvqTCcC8ud0?si=f2vIBZKxoCyZpDmz) to learn more.

## How do I get Hypno out of its Enclosure?

<details>

<summary>How do I get Hypno out of its enclosure?</summary>

Current versions of Hypno are attached to the enclosure with standard Eurorack m3 screws, simply unscrew them from the case to remove Hypno. For older versions, we made [a video to show you how](https://vimeo.com/472684965). For Hypno Kit see [here](https://youtu.be/QfaHEeOPxZY?t=322) (and reverse the process shown).&#x20;

</details>

## What kind of video outputs is Hypno Capable of?

<details>

<summary>What kind of video outputs is Hypno capable of?</summary>

Hypno has built in HDMI digital video output on the top or side of the unit, depending on your model. Certain Raspberry Pi versions include a TRRS multipack for composite output. The composite video can be standard definition NTSC or PAL (480i/576i). It is not possible to use both outputs simultaneously; Hypno will automatically use the HDMI output if it is connected to an active display on boot. If no display is detected, it will default to composite. NDI video output via USB is possible in either video output mode.

## How do I record Hypno's output?

<details>

<summary>How do I record Hypno’s output?</summary>

Hypno is capable of outputting three different video formats: HDMI (digital), composite (analog), and NDI (digital). We made a [video explaining](https://youtu.be/NDmuRfJRp7g?si=0HvoBbXP854ylhR3) one of the easiest ways to record Hypno with the free software [OBS](https://obsproject.com). Except for NDI, a capture device is required to stream Hypno’s video output into a computer. You can get started recording Hypno without additional hardware by using its NDI output over USB or Ethernet. Guides for setting up Hypno for NDI output are available for [Windows](https://forum.sleepycircuits.com/t/ndi-obs-setup-troubleshooting-guide-for-windows/165/) and [Mac](https://forum.sleepycircuits.com/t/ndi-obs-setup-troubleshooting-guide-for-mac/247)

</details>

## What other video devices can I use with Hypno?

<details>

<summary>What other video devices can I use with Hypno?</summary>

The sky is the limit! Because Hypno has both analog and digital outputs, you can patch it into tons of different analog video switchers (like the Roland V-4, as shown in [this video](https://youtu.be/GXriAjCdTdY?si=hQORZpemUjaUF3A9)) and digital video switchers (such as the Blackmagic Atem Mini or Roland V-4EX), or interface with [LZX video synthesizers](https://lzxindustries.net) and video glitch devices from [Syntonie](http://www.syntonie.fr/) and [BPMC](http://www.glitchart.com/). If you have a computer, you use programs like [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), [Resolume](https://www.resolume.com/), [GLMixer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/glmixer/), [Max](https://forum.sleepycircuits.com/t/hypno-max-demo/221) for post-processing and capture.\
You can also run video streams from analog and digital hardware (like an [iPad or iPhone](https://forum.sleepycircuits.com/t/how-to-use-ios-with-hypno/263?u=sleepybrian)) into Hypno’s engine for processing, further opening up new worlds of hypnotic visuals.&#x20;

## Will my synthesizer work with Hypno / Is Hypno audio reactive?

<details>

<summary>Will my synthesizer work with Hypno / Is Hypno audio reactive?</summary>

Short answer: yes! Hypno is compatible with both Eurorack control voltages and MIDI control. If your synthesizer, MIDI controller, modular, or groovebox can output either of these, you can use it to control Hypno and program animations that are timed to music. Our [Hypno & OP-Z Tutorial ](https://forum.sleepycircuits.com/t/how-to-use-op-z-with-hypno/145) goes over some basics for controlling your visuals with MIDI, while our [Making Audiovisuals with Mother-32 and Hypno](https://forum.sleepycircuits.com/t/how-to-make-audiovisuals-with-moog-mother-32-and-hypno/) video will teach you how to interface Hypno’s visuals with control signals from your musical synthesizers. We’ve also put together a large thread for [Making Audiovisual Patches with Hypno](https://forum.sleepycircuits.com/t/making-audiovisual-patches-with-hypno/) that discusses techniques for using MIDI or CV to control Hypno in time with music.

## What kind of signals can I patch into Hypno’s CV/Gate inputs?

<details>

<summary>What kind of signals can I patch into Hypno’s CV/Gate inputs?</summary>

Hypno’s 1/8"/3.5mm Eurorack-style inputs accept a range of +/-5V modulation signals from Eurorack and other modular synthesizers. Voltages above or below this range will be clipped. Do not patch any voltages greater than +/-12V into Hypno as this may damage the module.

<details>

<summary>How do I control Hypno with MIDI?</summary>

Hypno can accept MIDI control from class-compliant USB MIDI controllers and interfaces. Simply connect the MIDI device with a USB OTG cable ( you may need a microUSB adapter). The [online Hypno manual](hypno-manual.md) provides a table for the MIDI implementation and there’s a [short video tutorial](https://youtu.be/xghMVRDGoV8?si=4Jo2ODDqG_oWyKse) too. We’ve also released an informative [Hypno & OP-Z Tutorial ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxKJ7ShE5RI)which contains tons of useful tips for controlling Hypno with MIDI. MIDI devices we have tested are also documented in the [List of USB Accessories that work with Hypno](https://forum.sleepycircuits.com/t/list-of-usb-accessories-that-work-with-hypno/127).
